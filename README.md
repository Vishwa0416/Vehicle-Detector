# 🚗 Vehicle Detection App with YOLOv8 + Streamlit

This is an AI-powered image analysis tool built using **YOLOv8** and **Streamlit**. It allows users to upload an image and automatically detects various types of vehicles (car, bus, truck, motorcycle, etc.) within the image using a pre-trained object detection model.

## 🚀 Features

* 🧠 **Object Detection with YOLOv8**: Leverages a powerful model to detect and classify vehicles in real-time.
* 🖼️ **Image Upload Interface**: Easily upload images directly in the web UI.
* 📦 **Pre-trained Model**: Uses Ultralytics’ YOLOv8n model out of the box.
* 📋 **Instant Feedback**: Shows an annotated image and lists detected vehicles.
* 🧩 **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to upgrade with custom models or additional classes.
